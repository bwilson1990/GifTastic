# Giphy API

## Overview 

Created a website that is able to generate a button based on the text input 
and search through the .gif API library from giphy.com.

The specific tag for .gif results is "animal" to go along with my topic.

When the button is clicked, the page generates 10 image results from the Giphy API.

Also, this assignment shows how to use AJAX, a jQuery method to get the website url and API information
to be generated in the DOM.
